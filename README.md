## Installation and configuration
```bash
# Create environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
# Activate environment
conda activate sbo
``` 
## Data preparation
- Set the root directory for all datasets by changing the variable the variable `ROOT_DIR_STR` in `constants.py`. The downloaded datasets should be in the folder `ROOT_DIR_STR` (i.e. `../<ROOT_DIR_STR>/ml-1m/..`). 
- Modify the  obfuscation parameters in `constants.py`, an obfuscated dataset will be generated for each combination of these parameters inside the previously set root directory. Moreover, all the datasets are in [RecBole's](https://recbole.io) [atomic format](https://recbole.io/docs/user_guide/data/atomic_files.html).   
```bash
# Pre-process and generate standard format
python preprocess.py
```
## Run
- Execute the following command to generate the obfuscated datasets this will generate several parallel processes for generating the different datasets.
```bash
# Generate the obfuscated dataset files
python run_obfuscation.py
```
- To train the attacker networks on the obfuscated datasets run/adapt the script `scripts\run_train_attack.sh`.
```bash
cd scripts
sh run_train_attack.sh <DATASET_CONFIG> <DATASETS_FILES> 

# Example
# sh run_train_attack.sh ml-1m ../datasets_files/datasets_sample.json 
```
- To train the RecBole models on the obfuscated datasets run/adapt the script `scripts\run_recbole.sh`.
The script executes `pool_recs.py` code which is meant to run multiple jobs. Several `csv` files will be generated containing test results of the trained models. Additionally, given that our datasets are RecBole ready, indivual model can be trained following the [documentation](https://recbole.io/docs/get_started/started/general.html)
```bash
cd scripts
sh run_recbole.sh <DATASETS_FILES> <RECOMMENDER_MODEL> 

# Example
# sh run_recbole.sh ../datasets_files/datasets_sample.json BPR 
```
